## My process

I Started with HTML structure and the proceeded to the CSS whereby I styled it based on the 1440px screen size first. Then I styled it for the 375px optimal screen size.

### Built with

- HTML5 markup
- CSS properties

### What I learned

I learnt how to use the variable function.

```html
<a href="#">
  <button class="sedan">Learn more</button>
</a>
<a href="#">
  <button class="suv">Learn more</button>
</a>
```

```css
.sedan {
  color: hsl(31, 77%, 52%);
}
a {
  text-decoration: none;
  color: var(--sedan);
}
```

### Continued development

I will continue to hone my skills box model properties in the css so positioning and arrangment are areas I want to focus on more.
